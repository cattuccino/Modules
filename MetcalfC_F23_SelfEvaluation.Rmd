### What did you accomplish?

***

Please let me know how many of the above tasks you accomplished. If any of them were accomplished later than stipulated, please note that. If you contacted me about them being late (and we discussed it and I said it was ok), please note that, too. You may provide a bulleted/numbered list matching the one above.<br><br><br><br><br><br>

-Readings I focused mostly on the textbooks at the start of the semester, but then found them less helpful to read each week once I got more confident with my coding abilities, so I would only consult them when I needed troubleshooting help.
-Modules:
  -Modules from Week 2: https://github.com/cattuccino/AN588-Week-2/blob/main/AN588-Week-2.html 
  -Modules from Week 4 (Module 8; did not knit into html sorry!): https://github.com/cattuccino/AN588-Week-4-modules/blob/main/AN588-Week-4-cmetcalf.Rmd 
  -Modules 9-18, including 21 (Group 3 module content): All within same repo as rmd files https://github.com/cattuccino/Modules . Note: I did not complete the first week of group modules because I had technical difficulties, and then did not complete Group 5's module because of the large data download.
-Homework Sets (total= 5) with associated peer commentaries:
  -HW1: https://github.com/cattuccino/AN588-Week-2-cmetcalf/blob/main/cmetcalf_FinalHomeworkCode_01.html ; Peer Commentary for Lia (Chuhan) Bao: https://github.com/cbao2397/AN588-Week-2-chuhan/blob/main/chuhan_PeerCommentary_cmetcalf_01.html 
  -HW2: https://github.com/cattuccino/AN588-Week-3-cmetcalf/blob/main/cmetcalf_FinalHomeworkCode_02.html ; Peer Commentary for Emiley Garcia-Zych: https://github.com/EmileyGarciaZych/AN558-Week3-emileygz/blob/master/cmetcalf_PeerCommentary_Emileygz_02.html 
  -HW3: https://github.com/cattuccino/AN588-Zombies-cmetcalf/blob/main/cmetcalf_FinalHomeworkCode_03.html ; Peer Commentary for Samantha Vee: https://github.com/samanthavee/AN588_Zombies_svee/blob/master/svee_PeerCommentary_cmetcalf_03.html
  -HW4: Had difficulties with knitting into html that I could not fix because of an issue with git, so linking the repository and original homework code before final version (final version is in repo as an rmarkdown!) https://github.com/cattuccino/AN588_Malfunction_cmetcalf and original: https://github.com/cattuccino/AN588_Malfunction_cmetcalf/blob/main/cmetcalf_OriginalHomeworkCode_04.html ; Peer commentary for Reese Hotten-Sommers: https://github.com/rhottensomers/AN588_Malfunction_reesehs/blob/main/cmetcalf_PeerCommentary_reesehs.html 
  -HW5: https://github.com/cattuccino/AN588_Boots_cmetcalf/blob/main/cmetcalf_FinalHomeworkCode_05.html ; Peer Commentary for Paige Becker: https://github.com/paigebecker1/AN588_Boots_pbecker/blob/main/cmetcalf_PeerCommentary_pbecker_05.html

### How well did you accomplish them?

***

Please let me know how well you feel you accomplished your tasks, in a general sense. What do you feel you did the best, and what did you do the least well? What was the hardest part for you? Did your work/understanding/ease improve over the course of the semester?<br><br><br><br><br><br>

### How has your understanding of and approach to statistics and project design changed since taking this course?

***

This may be in relation to previous knowledge, or in relation to future/planned work.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

### What did you learn from all this?

***

Please name at least three things you feel you learned in this course.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
